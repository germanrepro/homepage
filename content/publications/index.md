**Quality research needs good working conditions**
A new paper published together with members of the German Reproducibility Network calls for a major overhaul of academic systems to improve the quality of research. The paper, entitled “Quality research needs good working conditions,” highlights the need for researchers to have appropriate employment and working conditions to achieve high-quality research.

The authors argue that many national academic systems rely on short-term employment contracts, biased selection procedures and misaligned incentives, which hinder research quality and progress. To address these issues, the authors discuss ways to redesign academic systems, arguing that it is imperative that academic institutions create an environment in which employment conditions, incentives, and routines prioritize good research practice. This includes providing stable and secure employment. Permanent employment allows researchers to focus on their work, develop long-term projects, and maintain a high level of rigor.

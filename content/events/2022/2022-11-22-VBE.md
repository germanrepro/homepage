This virtual brainstorming event from November 22-23, 2022 will bring together individuals in Germany who are passionate about reproducibility and open science, including members of the German Reproducibility Network. Participants will share experiences and strategies on how to build, grow, and sustain initiatives that focus on reproducibility and open science. We welcome participants who are just starting initiatives or are interested in starting initiatives, along with those who are participating in or leading established initiatives. We will explore techniques for starting new initiatives, as well as strategies for expanding existing initiatives and making an initiative sustainable.

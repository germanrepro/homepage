[Reproducibility for Everyone](https://repro4everyone.org/) (R4E) is a community-led education project to increase adoption of open research practices at scale. R4E volunteer co-instructors run over 20 workshops per year at premier scientific conferences. Since 2018, R4E volunteers have run workshops on 6 continents for thousands of researchers!

This June, we want to highlight the impact of R4Eâ€™s work so far with the #R4EtaughtMe campaign. Please help amplify the lessons learned by researchers all over the world by sharing our #R4EtaughtMe posts!

If you are looking for a way to show your support for a community-led project like ours, please consider making a donation during our #R4EtaughtMe campaign. Even $3 helps keep us going and supports R4E Stipends for under-represented researchers!

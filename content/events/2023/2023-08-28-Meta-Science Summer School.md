Concerned about the reproducibility and transparency of research? Interested in learning more about meta-research, or the science of science? Looking for hands-on experience? Excited to work with other early career researchers across disciplines?

The German Reproducibility Network (GRN), the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) and the META REP Program organize a Meta-Science Summer School to teach students as well as Phd-students more about meta-research by designing, conducting, and publishing a meta-research study in a small team. The Summer School is funded by a grant of the Volkswagen Foundation.

The event will take place from August 28 to September 1 in Frankfurt am Main. There are no participation fees, travel expenses can be reimbursed to a limited extent. All further information about the Summer School as well as the application process can be found on the [event page](https://www.bihealth.org/de/aktuell/meta-science-summer-school-designing-studies-to-improve-research-1).

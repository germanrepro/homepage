**The German Reproducibility Day is dedicated to all stakeholders of the scientific landscape in Germany and beyond.** The first event aims to raise awareness and discuss the relevance of reproducible and robust research, why a strong network of initiatives working towards open research in Germany is needed, and what this network’s role and mission should be. Specific examples from GRN members will be used to show how to implement and promote reproducibility. There will also be enough space for social interaction and exchange.

Registration will open soon.

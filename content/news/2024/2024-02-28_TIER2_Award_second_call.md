date = 2024-02-28

As the GRN we would like to share the second call by TIER2 for the launch of new Reproducibility Networks across Europe:

Establish a Reproducibility Network in a Horizon Europe “Widening Participation” country
TIER2, an international project funded by the EU’s Horizon Europe programme, aims to broaden our knowledge and understanding of reproducibility, co-create and test tools, engage and grow communities, and implement high-quality policies.
To increase the trustworthiness of scientific work and to empower Reproducibility Networks (RNs), TIER2 is fostering the creation of three new RNs in Horizon Europe “Widening Participation” countries. The first open call resulted in the awarding of two consortia in Ukraine and Georgia in 2023. Via a second open call, consortia can now apply for the third award of €5,000 to fund an initial meeting to establish an RN in their country. The granted award money may be used for expenses directly related to the establishment meeting, including travel expenses, venue costs, setting up of a website, advertisement, technical setup, and consumables. 
Selection will be based on the feasibility, scope, and sustainability of the proposal. **The application deadline is Monday, April 1st at 11pm/23:00 (CET).**

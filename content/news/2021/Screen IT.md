ScreenIT reports on COVID-19 preprints are now available through [Sciety](https://sciety.org), a free platform that allows readers to quickly find and examine peer review reports on bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. ScreenIT is a collection of automated tools that screen preprints for common problems that affect transparency and reproducibility (e.g. reporting of blinding and randomization, power calculations, protocol pre-registration, limitations sections, etc.). Learn more about how you can use Sciety to access ScreenIT reports, as well as peer reviews of COVID-19 preprints [here](https://blog.sciety.org/covid-groups/)

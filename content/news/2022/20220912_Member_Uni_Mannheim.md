We are pleased to welcome the [University of Mannheim ](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/) as new institutional member of the German Reproducibility Network (GRN). It is also the first university to join our network. The University of Mannheim has already established an Open Science Office to support researchers in implementing open science practices and bring open science issues into strategic discussions at the university.

Professor Henning Hillmann (Vice President for Research and Early-Stage Researchers) states: “Research practices are evolving, and the University of Mannheim is committed to leading the way in this shift toward openness and transparency. Membership in the GRN underlines this commitment and connects us on a national level with the other players in this area. We are proud to be part of the GRN and look forward to the future collaboration.”

The GRN steering committee has published a statement on open data. In this statement, we propose five action items what is needed to improve the accessibility of research data generated by academia.
* Open data should be the standard
* For data that cannot be open data use and access concepts need to be developed
* Making data accessible should factor into researcher assessment
* Funders should require data to be open 
* Academic institutions need to provide not only infrastructure but also support structures
 
The statement was written by Ulf Toelch and Felix Sch√∂nbrodt for the GRN steering committee and received input from the GRN members. As the statement is addressed at German stakeholders it is in German. It can be accessed at: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6840403](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6840403)

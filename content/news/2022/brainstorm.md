*March 2-3rd, 2022*

More than 90 participants took part in a joint virtual brainstorming event concerning **education about reproducibility and open science**. 

A variety of issues were discussed, such as resources and strategies used in training and opportunities to further improve reproducibility education in Germany, and project ideas and education material were developed. 
This was a great first starting point for next steps on the local as well as national level.

**Thank you to all our participants for this wonderful event!**

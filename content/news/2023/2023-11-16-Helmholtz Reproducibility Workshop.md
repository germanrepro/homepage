Dear GRN members and friends,

on November 16, 2023, from 9 am to 3 pm, the third workshop on Reproducibility in Sciences, again jointly organized by the [Helmholtz Open Science Office](https://os.helmholtz.de/) and [Helmholtz Information & Data Science Academy (HIDA)](https://www.helmholtz-hida.de/), will take place at the Telegrafenberg in Potsdam, hosted by the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ.

The workshop begins with two keynotes on reproducibility, one focusing on Image Data Analysis by Deborah Schmidt (HIP, MDC) and the other on open science and research software engineering by Oliver Bertuch (FZJ) (both sessions will also be livestreamed). Following the keynotes, attendees can choose from a selection of three workshops that will equip you with the tools and insights needed to make reproducibility a cornerstone of your scientific endeavors. The event will conclude with a shared lunch, providing ample networking opportunities for all participants.

Registration is open until October 31, 2023 via [https://events.hifis.net/event/998/registrations](https://events.hifis.net/event/998/registrations). Please also register if you would like to attend the keynotes online. The event is free of charge and only a few seats are left, so register soon.
